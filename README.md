# DeFacto MVP

This is the repository for the development of the DeFacto MVP.

## What is DeFacto?

DeFacto is a project that aims to combat misinformation online. Anyone can install the browser extension and enjoy reading an assessment of the content of any web page.

## Who writes the assessments?

DeFacto is a permissionless collaborative network. This means that anyone can join to participate in peer-reviewing the internet. Eventually, the combination of a built-in reputation and online voting system will make sure that the content cannot be easily manipulated.

## Why should I install the extension?

It is estimated that the amount of false information could exceed trustworthy information on the internet by the end of the decade. It is important to have tools at our disposal that helps us see through inaccurate content.

## Why should I become a reviewer?

The DeFacto system cannot work without the help of a network of reviewers. However, content assessment can be a complex task. This is why honest reviewers (defined elsewhere) are rewarded with tokens that can be redeemed for real world money.

## What does this MVP do?

This MVP is a simple implementation that is mainly aimed at experimenting with the user experience. A lot of development work is still required to fulfill our full vision. Stay tuned for updates!
