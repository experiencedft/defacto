# Installation

Download the extension folder and install the unpacked extension in Chrome using the developer mode.

# How to use

The extension currently does only two things: clicking "Submit tab" will add the current tab URL to the sync storage and clicking "Start reviewing" will open a static assessment form including a dropdown that is dynamically constructed and filled with all the URLs stored in the sync storage.
